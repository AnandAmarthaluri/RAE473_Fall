# Distributed Systems and their Features
## Case Nr. 1
A server program written in one programming language (for example C++) provides the implementation of a BLOB (Binary Large Object) object that is intended to be accessed by clients that may be written in a different language (for example Java). The client and server computers may have different hardware, but all of them are attached to an internet.

###### *Question*
Describe the problems due to each of the five aspects of heterogeneity that need to be solved to make it possible for a client object to invoke a method on the server object.
